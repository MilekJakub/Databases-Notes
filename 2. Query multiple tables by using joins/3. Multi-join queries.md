It's important to remember that a join in T-SQL takes place conceptually between two tables at a time.

A multi-join query evaluates the joins conceptually from left to right. So the result of one join is used as the left input to the next join. It is important especially when outer joins are involved. With inner and cross joins, the order cannot affect this meaning.
