**Cross join**
Cross join performs multiplication between tables, yielding a row for each combination of rows from both sides.
The cross join is the result of linking every record from one table with every record from a related table.

**Inner Join**
With an inner join, you can match rows from two tables based on a predicate - usually one that compares a primary key value in one side to a foreign key value in another side.

**Outer joins**

Left join:
to a result set containing records resulting from an inner join, all records are added from the table placed to the left side of the operator which do not have corresponding records in the related table.

Right join:
to a result set containing records resulting from an inner join, all records are added from the table placed to the right side of the operator which do not have corresponding records in the related table

Full join:
to result set containing records resulting from an inner join, all record are added from the table placed to the left side of the operator which do have corresponding records in the second table and all records from the second table which do not have corresponding records in the first table
