When you need to join tables that are related based on multiple columns, the join is called **composite join** and the ON clause typically consists of a conjuction of predicates (predicates separated by AND operators) that match the corresponding columns from the two sides.

Sometimes you need more complex predicates, especially when NULLs are involved.

```T-SQL
SELECT el.country, el.region, el.city, el.numemps, cl.numcusts
FROM EmpLocations AS el
    INNER JOIN CustLocations AS cl
    ON el.country = cl.country
    AND	(el.region = cl.region OR (el.region IS NULL AND cl.region IS NULL)) 
    AND el.city = cl.city
```
