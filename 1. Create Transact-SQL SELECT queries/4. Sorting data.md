A table in T-SQL is supposed to represent a relation; a relations is a set, and a set has no order to its elements.
With this in mind, unless you explicitly instruct the query otherwise, the result of a query has no guaranteed order.

In case the DINSTINCT clause is used, you are limited in the ORDER BY list to only elements that appear in the SELECT list.

In SQL Server NULLS are sorted before other values when we use ORDER BY ASC.
