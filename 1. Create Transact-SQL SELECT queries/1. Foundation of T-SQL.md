Relational model originates from Set Theory and Predicate Logic.

Set has no duplicates.
Set has no order.

Using T-SQL it is possible to obtain duplicated rows.
T-SQL is based more on multiset theory than on set theory.
A multiset (also known as a bag or superset) can have duplicates.

Fundamental aspect of a set is that there's no relevance to the order of elements.
The result with ORDER BY clause isn't relational, it's what standard SQL calls a cursor.

According to mathematical logic a predicate can evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.
So, predicates are supposed to use two-valued logic.
Codd wanted to reflect the possibility for values to be missing.
T-SQL implements NULL for any kind of missing values.
This leads to a three-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, NULL).

NULL isn't a value, rather is a mark for a missing value.
