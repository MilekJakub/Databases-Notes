The APPLY operator you can use to apply a table expression given to it as the right input to each row from a table expression given to it as the left input.

The OUTER APPLY operator does what the CROSS APPLY operator does, but also includes in the result rows from the left side that get an empty set back from the right side (like OUTER JOIN).
