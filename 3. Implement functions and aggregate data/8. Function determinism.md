Function determinism is a characteristic that indicates whether the function is guaranteed to return the same result given the same set of input values (including an empty set) in different invocations.

If the function provides such a guarantee, it is said to be deterministic; otherwise it is said to be nondeterministic.

There are three main categories of function determinism.
There are functions that are:

- always deterministric,
- deterministic when invoked in a certain way,
- always nondeterministic.

Non deterministic functions are invoked once per query. That’s the case for instance with SYSDATETIME and RAND (when invoked without the seed).

The NEWID is an exception in the sense that it gets invoked per row.

Ex.

```T-SQL
SELECT TOP 3 BusinessEntityID, SYSDATETIME() AS dtnow, RAND() AS random, NEWID() AS newguid
FROM [HumanResources].[Employee]
```
