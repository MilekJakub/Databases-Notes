**Arithmetic operators**

The data types of the operands in an arithmetic computation determine the data type of the result.

```T-SQL
SELECT 9 / 2;
```
With integer division the result is 4 not 4.5.

When the operands are integer columns or parameters, but you need numeric division, you have two options:

Explicitly cast the operands:
```T-SQL
SELECT CAST(9 AS NUMERIC(4,2)) / CAST(2 AS NUMERIC(4,2));
```

Multiply the first operand by a numeric constant:
```T-SQL
SELECT (1.0 * 9) / (1.0 * 2)
```

**Aggregate functions**

Aggregate functions you apply to set of rows and get a single value back.
T-SQL supports aggregate functions such as: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX and others.

Aggregate functions ignore NULL inputs.
If you want to apply an aggregate function to distinct values, add the DISTINCT clause:
`COUNT(DISTINCT column_name)`

The `COUNT(*)` aggregate just counts rows, and returns the result as an INT value. 
Use `COUNT_BIG` to return the row count as a BIGINT value.

Like with arithmetic operators, also with aggregate functions like AVG, the data type of the input determines the data type of the result.
