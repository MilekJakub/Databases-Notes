A search argument (or SARG in short) is a filter predicate that enables the optimizer to rely on index order.

The filter predicate:
`WHERE column operator expression`
is searchable if:

- You don’t apply manipulation to the filtered column
- The operator identifies a consecutive range of qualifying rows in the index.

That is the case with operator like:
- = 
- \> 
- \>= 
- < 
- <=
- BETWEEN
- LIKE with a known prefix ( SELECT * FROM imiona WHERE imie LIKE 'Jakub'; )

That is not a case with operators like
- !=
- LIKE with a wildcard as prefix ( SELECT * FROM imiona WHERE imie LIKE 'J%'; )

In most cases when you apply manipulation to the filtered column, index ordering can’t be trusted (column is not a SARG).

So instead:

```T-SQL
SELECT orderid, orderdate FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(orderdate) = 2018;
```

use:

```T-SQL
SELECT orderid, orderdate FROM Orders WHERE orderdate >= '20180101' AND orderdate <= '20181231';
-- OR
SELECT orderid, orderdate FROM Orders WHERE orderdate BETWEEN '20180101' AND '20181231';
```
