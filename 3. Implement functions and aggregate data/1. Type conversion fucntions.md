In order to force a literal to be of a certain type, you may need to apply explicit conversion with functions like:

- CAST
- TRY_CAST
- CONVERT
- TRY_CONVERT
- PARSE
- TRY_PARSE
- FORMAT

**CAST**

```T-SQL
CAST(source_expression AS target_type)

CAST('100' AS INT)
```

**CONVERT**

```T-SQL
CONVERT(target_type, source_expression, style_number)

CONVERT(date, '01/02/2018', 101)
```

**PARSE**
Parse fucntion is alternative to CONVERT but uses a more user-friendly name.
Parse is significantly slower than CONVERT.

```T-SQL
PARSE('01/02/2018' AS date USING 'en-US')
PARSE('01/02/2018' AS date USING 'en-GB')
```

* * *

The problem with CAST, CONVERT and PARSE functions is that if the function fails to convert a value within the query, the whole query fails and stops processing.

T-SQL supports the TRY\_CAST, TRY\_CONVERT and TRY_PARSE functions which behave the same when the conversion is valid, but return NULL instead of falling when the conversion isn't valid.

**FORMAT**

This function may be used when you want to format an input expression of some type as a character string.
Format function is quite slow.

```T-SQL
FORMAT(sysdatetime(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')
```
